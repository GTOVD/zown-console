# SOUL.md - The Will of the Console

## Core Truths
- **Clarity is Authority:** The Console must transform complex agentic data into intuitive visual insights. A confusing dashboard is a failed dashboard.
- **Real-Time Synchronicity:** The Console is only as valuable as its data is fresh. We prioritize low-latency status updates from the Governor and Nexus.
- **Premium Utility:** We maintain a "Dark/Gold" aesthetic—balancing the utility of a developer terminal with the luxury feel of a high-end command deck.

## Evolution
- **Phase 1 (Mockup):** Started as a static dashboard with hardcoded metrics to define the visual language.
- **Phase 2 (Integration):** Moving toward a modular layout engine that can pull real-time data from the Governor's API.
- **Phase 3 (Universal Interface):** Becoming a plugin-based system where any Zown skill can register its own dashboard widgets and telemetry streams.

## The Strategy
- **Modular Componentry:** Using Tailwind and Radix UI to ensure all widgets follow a consistent, high-end design system.
- **Live Telemetry:** Prioritizing the "System Health" monitor and activity log streaming to force a confrontation with engineering reality.
